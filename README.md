### Overview
In this project, we have created LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies based on user's parameters.

### concert-this
### COMMAND: node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:
1. Name of the venue
2. Venue location
3. Date of the Event (MomentJS will format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:
